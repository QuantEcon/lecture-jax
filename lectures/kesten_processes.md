In addition to what's in Anaconda, this lecture will need the following libraries:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-output]

!pip install quantecon
```

## Overview

This lecture describes Kesten processes, which are an important class of
stochastic processes, and an application of firm dynamics.

The lecture draws on [an earlier QuantEcon
lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/kesten_processes.html), which uses Numba
to accelerate the computations.

In that earlier lecture you can find a more detailed discussion of the concepts involved.

This lecture focuses on implementing the same computations in JAX.

Let's start with some imports:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import quantecon as qe
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import random
```

## Kesten processes

```{index} single: Kesten processes; heavy tails
```

A **Kesten process** is a stochastic process of the form

```{math}
:label: kesproc

X_{t+1} = a_{t+1} X_t + \eta_{t+1}
```

where $\{a_t\}_{t \geq 1}$ and $\{\eta_t\}_{t \geq 1}$ are IID
sequences.

We are interested in the dynamics of $\{X_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ when $X_0$ is given.

We will focus on the nonnegative scalar case, where $X_t$ takes values in $\mathbb R_+$.

In particular, we will assume that

* the initial condition $X_0$ is nonnegative,
* $\{a_t\}_{t \geq 1}$ is a nonnegative IID stochastic process and
* $\{\eta_t\}_{t \geq 1}$ is another nonnegative IID stochastic process, independent of the first.


### Application: firm dynamics

In this section we apply Kesten process theory to the study of firm dynamics.


#### Gibrat's law

It was postulated many years ago by Robert Gibrat that firm size evolves
according to a simple rule whereby size next period is proportional to current
size.

This is now known as [Gibrat's law of proportional growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibrat%27s_law).

We can express this idea by stating that a suitably defined measure
$s_t$ of firm size obeys

```{math}
:label: firm_dynam_gb

\frac{s_{t+1}}{s_t} = a_{t+1}
```

for some positive IID sequence $\{a_t\}$.

Subsequent empirical research has shown that this specification is not accurate,
particularly for small firms.

However, we can get close to the data by modifying {eq}`firm_dynam_gb` to

```{math}
:label: firm_dynam

s_{t+1} = a_{t+1} s_t + b_{t+1}
```

where $\{a_t\}$ and $\{b_t\}$ are both IID and independent of each
other.

We now study the implications of this specification.

#### Heavy tails

If the conditions of the [Kesten--Goldie
Theorem](https://python.quantecon.org/kesten_processes.html#the-kestengoldie-theorem)
are satisfied, then {eq}`firm_dynam` implies that the firm size distribution
will have Pareto tails.

This matches empirical findings across many data sets.

But there is another unrealistic aspect of the firm dynamics specified in {eq}`firm_dynam` that we need to address: it ignores entry and exit.

In any given period and in any given market, we observe significant numbers of
firms entering and exiting the market.

In this setting, firm dynamics can be expressed as

```{math}
:label: firm_dynam_ee
    s_{t+1} = e_{t+1} \mathbb{1}\{s_t < \bar s\} +
    (a_{t+1} s_t + b_{t+1}) \mathbb{1}\{s_t \geq \bar s\}
```

The motivation behind and interpretation of [](firm_dynam_ee) can be found in 
[our earlier Kesten process lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/kesten_processes.html).

What can we say about dynamics?

Although {eq}`firm_dynam_ee` is not a Kesten process, it does update in the
same way as a Kesten process when $s_t$ is large.

So perhaps its stationary distribution still has Pareto tails?

We can investigate this question via simulation and rank-size plots.

The approach will be to

1. generate $M$ draws of $s_T$ when $M$ and $T$ are
   large and
1. plot the largest 1,000 of the resulting draws in a rank-size plot.

(The distribution of $s_T$ will be close to the stationary distribution
when $T$ is large.)

In the simulation, we assume that each of $a_t, b_t$ and $e_t$ is lognormal.

Here's code to update a cross-section of firms according to the dynamics in
[](firm_dynam_ee).

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def update_s(s, s_bar, a_random, b_random, e_random):
    exp_a = jnp.exp(a_random)
    exp_b = jnp.exp(b_random)
    exp_e = jnp.exp(e_random)

    s = jnp.where(s < s_bar,
                  exp_e,
                  exp_a * s + exp_b)

    return s
```

Now we write a for loop that repeatedly calls this function, to push a
cross-section of firms forward in time.

For sufficiently large `T`, the cross-section it returns (the cross-section at
time `T`) corresponds to firm size distribution in (approximate) equilibrium.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def generate_draws(M=1_000_000,
                   μ_a=-0.5,
                   σ_a=0.1,
                   μ_b=0.0,
                   σ_b=0.5,
                   μ_e=0.0,
                   σ_e=0.5,
                   s_bar=1.0,
                   T=500,
                   s_init=1.0,
                   seed=123):

    key = random.PRNGKey(seed)

    # Initialize the array of s values with the initial value
    s = jnp.full((M, ), s_init)

    # Perform updates on s for time t
    for t in range(T):
        keys = random.split(key, 3)
        a_random = μ_a + σ_a * random.normal(keys[0], (M, ))
        b_random = μ_b + σ_b * random.normal(keys[1], (M, ))
        e_random = μ_e + σ_e * random.normal(keys[2], (M, ))

        s = update_s(s, s_bar, a_random, b_random, e_random)
        
        # Generate new key for the next iteration
        key = random.fold_in(key, t)

    return s

%time data = generate_draws().block_until_ready()
```

Running the above function again so we can see the speed with and without compile time.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time data = generate_draws().block_until_ready()
```

Notice that we do not JIT-compile the `for` loops, since

1. acceleration of the outer loop makes little difference terms of compute
   time and
2. compiling the outer loop is often very slow.

Let's produce the rank-size plot and check the distribution:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

rank_data, size_data = qe.rank_size(data, c=0.01)
ax.loglog(rank_data, size_data, 'o', markersize=3.0, alpha=0.5)
ax.set_xlabel("log rank")
ax.set_ylabel("log size")

plt.show()
```

The plot produces a straight line, consistent with a Pareto tail.


#### Alternative implementation with `lax.scan`

If the time horizon is not too large, we can try to further accelerate our code
by replacing the `for` loop with
[`lax.scan`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html).

Note, however, that

1. as mentioned above, there is not much speed gain in accelerating outer loops,
2. `lax.scan` has a more complicated syntax, and, most importantly,
3. the `lax.scan` implementation consumes far more memory, as we need to have to
   store large matrices of random draws

Hence the code below will fail due to out-of-memory errors when `T` and `M` are large.

Here is the `lax.scan` version:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from jax import lax

@jax.jit
def generate_draws_lax(μ_a=-0.5,
                       σ_a=0.1,
                       μ_b=0.0,
                       σ_b=0.5,
                       μ_e=0.0,
                       σ_e=0.5,
                       s_bar=1.0,
                       T=500,
                       M=500_000,
                       s_init=1.0,
                       seed=123):

    key = random.PRNGKey(seed)
    keys = random.split(key, 3)
    
    # Generate random draws and initial values
    a_random = μ_a + σ_a * random.normal(keys[0], (T, M))
    b_random = μ_b + σ_b * random.normal(keys[1], (T, M))
    e_random = μ_e + σ_e * random.normal(keys[2], (T, M))
    s = jnp.full((M, ), s_init)

    # Define the function for each update
    def update_s(s, a_b_e_draws):
        a, b, e = a_b_e_draws
        s = jnp.where(s < s_bar,
                      jnp.exp(e),
                      jnp.exp(a) * s + jnp.exp(b))
        return s, None

    # Use lax.scan to perform the calculations on all states
    s_final, _ = lax.scan(update_s, s, (a_random, b_random, e_random))
    return s_final

%time data = generate_draws_lax().block_until_ready()
```

In this case, `M` is small enough for the code to run and
we see some speed gain over the for loop implementation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time data = generate_draws_lax().block_until_ready()
```

Here we produce the same rank-size plot:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

rank_data, size_data = qe.rank_size(data, c=0.01)
ax.loglog(rank_data, size_data, 'o', markersize=3.0, alpha=0.5)
ax.set_xlabel("log rank")
ax.set_ylabel("log size")

plt.show()
```

Let's rerun the `for` loop version on smaller `M` to compare the speed

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time generate_draws(M=500_000).block_until_ready()
```

We see that the `lax.scan` version is faster than the `for` loop version 
when memory is not an issue.
