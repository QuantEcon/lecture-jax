# Inventory Dynamics

```{include} _admonition/gpu.md
```

```{index} single: Markov process, inventory
```

## Overview

This lecture explores the inventory dynamics of a firm using so-called s-S inventory control.

Loosely speaking, this means that the firm 

* waits until inventory falls below some value $s$
* and then restocks with a bulk order of $S$ units (or, in some models, restocks up to level $S$).

We will be interested in the stationary distribution of the model, which can be
thought of as a steady state cross-sectional distribution of inventory levels
across a large number of firms, all of which have the same dynamics.

We studied this distribution in a [separate
lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/inventory_dynamics.html), using Numba.

Here we study the same problem using JAX.

We will use the following imports:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import random, lax
from collections import namedtuple
```

Here's a description of our GPU:

```{code-cell} ipython3
!nvidia-smi
```

## Sample paths

Consider a firm with inventory $X_t$.

The firm waits until $X_t \leq s$ and then restocks up to $S$ units.

It faces stochastic demand $\{ D_t \}$, which we assume is IID.

With notation $a^+ := \max\{a, 0\}$, inventory dynamics can be written
as

$$
X_{t+1} =
    \begin{cases}
      ( S - D_{t+1})^+ & \quad \text{if } X_t \leq s \\
      ( X_t - D_{t+1} )^+ &  \quad \text{if } X_t > s
    \end{cases}
$$

(See our earlier [lecture on inventory dynamics](https://python.quantecon.org/inventory_dynamics.html) for background and motivation.)

In what follows, we will assume that each $D_t$ is lognormal, so that

$$
    D_t = \exp(\mu + \sigma Z_t)
$$

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are parameters and $\{Z_t\}$ is IID
and standard normal.

Here's a `namedtuple` that stores parameters.

```{code-cell} ipython3
Parameters = namedtuple('Parameters', ['s', 'S', 'mu', 'sigma'])

# Create a default instance
params = Parameters(s=10, S=100, mu=1.0, sigma=0.5)
```

## Marginal distributions

Now letâ€™s look at the marginal distribution $\psi_T$ of $X_T$ for some fixed $T$.

We will approximate this distribution by 

1. fixing $n$ to be some large number, indicating the number of firms in the
   simulation,
1. fixing $T$, the time period we are interested in,
1. generating $n$ independent draws from some fixed distribution $\psi_0$ that gives the
   initial cross-sectional distribution of firms, and
1. shift this distribution forward in time $T$ periods, by updating each firm
   independently via the dynamics described above.

This process gives us $\psi_T$, a distribution of firm inventory levels.

We will then use various methods to visualize $\psi_T$, such as historgrams and
kernel density estimates.

We will use the following code to update a cross-section of firms by one period.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Define a jit-compiled function to update X and key
@jax.jit
def update_cross_section(params, X_vec, D):
    """
    Update cross-section X_vec by one period, given the vector of demand shocks
    in D (D[i] is the shock for firm i with current inventory X_vec[i]).

    """
    # Unpack
    s, S = params.s, params.S
    # Restock if the inventory is below the threshold
    X_new = jnp.where(X_vec <= s, 
                      jnp.maximum(S - D, 0), jnp.maximum(X_vec - D, 0))
    return X_new
```

### For loop version

Here's code to compute the cross-sectional distribution $\psi_T$.

In this code we use an ordinary Python `for` loop.

Using an ordinary `for` loop is reasonable here because

1. efficiency of outer loops has less influence on runtime than efficiency of inner loops.
1. using `jax.jit` to compile `for` loops can be time consuming.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_cross_section(params, x_init, T, key, num_firms=50_000):
    # Set up initial distribution
    X_vec = jnp.full((num_firms, ), x_init)
    # Loop
    for i in range(T):
        Z = random.normal(key, shape=(num_firms, ))
        D = jnp.exp(params.mu + params.sigma * Z)

        X_vec = update_cross_section(params, X_vec, D)
        _, key = random.split(key)

    return X_vec
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_init = 50
T = 500
key = random.PRNGKey(10)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time X_vec = compute_cross_section(params, x_init, T, key).block_until_ready()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time X_vec = compute_cross_section(params, x_init, T, key).block_until_ready()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(X_vec, bins=50, 
        density=True, 
        label=f'cross-section when $t = {T}$')
ax.set_xlabel('inventory')
ax.set_ylabel('probability')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Compiling the outer loop

For relatively small problems, we can make this code run faster by compiling the outer loop as well.

We will do this using `jax.jit` and a `fori_loop`, which is a compiler-ready version of a for loop provided by JAX.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_cross_section_fori(params, x_init, T, key, num_firms=50_000):

    s, S, mu, sigma = params.s, params.S, params.mu, params.sigma
    X = jnp.full((num_firms, ), x_init)
    Z = random.normal(key, shape=(T, num_firms))
    D = jnp.exp(mu + sigma * Z)

    # Define the function for each update
    def update_cross_section(i, X):
        X = jnp.where(X <= s,
                  jnp.maximum(S - D[i, :], 0),
                  jnp.maximum(X - D[i, :], 0))
        return X

    # Use lax.scan to perform the calculations on all states
    X = lax.fori_loop(0, T, update_cross_section, X)

    return X

# Compile taking T and num_firms as static (changes trigger recomplie)
compute_cross_section_fori = jax.jit(
    compute_cross_section_fori, static_argnums=(2, 4))
```

Let's test it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time X_vec = compute_cross_section_fori(params, x_init, T, key).block_until_ready()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time X_vec = compute_cross_section_compiled(params, x_init, T, key).block_until_ready()
```

The benefit of the `fori_loop` implementation is that we compile the whole
operation.

The disadvantages are that

1. there are only limited speed gains in accelerating outer loops,
2. `lax.fori_loop` has a more complicated syntax, and, most importantly,
3. the `lax.fori_loop` implementation consumes far more memory, as we need to have to
   store large matrices of random draws

The high memory consumption aspect of the `fori_loop` version becomes problematic for large problems.

## Plotting with a kernel density estimate


We can also represent the distribution using a [kernel density
estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation).

Kernel density estimators can be thought of as smoothed histograms.

The advantage of a kernel density estimator for this setting is that it's
relatively easy to plot the cross section at multiple dates on the same plot.

We will use a kernel density estimator from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

We will generate and plot the sequence $\{\psi_t\}$ at times
$t = 10, 50, 250, 500, 750$ using the kernel density estimator.

Here is code that repeatedly shifts the cross-section forward in time while
recording the cross-section at the dates in `sample_dates`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def shift_forward_and_sample(x_init, params, sample_dates,
                        key, num_firms=50_000, sim_length=750):

    X = res = jnp.full((num_firms, ), x_init)

    # Use for loop to update X and collect samples
    for i in range(sim_length):
        Z = random.normal(key, shape=(num_firms, ))
        D = jnp.exp(params.mu + params.sigma * Z)

        X = update_cross_section(params, X, D)
        _, key = random.split(key)

        # draw a sample at the sample dates
        if (i+1 in sample_dates):
          res = jnp.vstack((res, X))

    return res[1:]
```

Let's test it

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_init = 50
num_firms = 10_000
sample_dates = 10, 50, 250, 500, 750
key = random.PRNGKey(10)


%time X = shift_forward_and_sample(x_init, params, \
                              sample_dates, key).block_until_ready()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

for i, date in enumerate(sample_dates):
    ax.hist(X[i, :], bins=50, 
            density=True, 
            histtype='step',
            label=f'cross-section when $t = {date}$')

ax.set_xlabel('inventory')
ax.set_ylabel('probability')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

This model for inventory dynamics is asymptotically stationary, with a unique
stationary distribution.

In particular, the sequence of marginal distributions $\{\psi_t\}$
converges to a unique limiting distribution that does not depend on
initial conditions.

Although we will not prove this here, we see it in the simulation above.

By $t=500$ or $t=750$ the densities are barely changing.

If you test a few different initial conditions, you will see that they do not affect long-run outcomes.


## Restock frequency

As an exercise, let's study the probability of firms needing to restock over a
given time perion.

In the exercise, we will

* set the starting stock level to $X_0 = 70$ and
* calculate the proportion of firms that need to order twice or more in the first 50 periods.

This proportion approximates the probability of the event when the sample size
is large.


### For loop version

We start with an easier `for` loop implementation

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Define a jitted function for each update
@jax.jit
def update_stock(n_restock, X, params, D):
    n_restock = jnp.where(X <= params.s,
                          n_restock + 1,
                          n_restock)
    X = jnp.where(X <= params.s,
                  jnp.maximum(params.S - D, 0),
                  jnp.maximum(X - D, 0))
    return n_restock, X, key

def compute_freq(params, key,
                 x_init=70,
                 sim_length=50,
                 num_firms=1_000_000):

    # Prepare initial arrays
    X = jnp.full((num_firms, ), x_init)

    # Stack the restock counter on top of the inventory
    n_restock = jnp.zeros((num_firms, ))

    # Use a for loop to perform the calculations on all states
    for i in range(sim_length):
        Z = random.normal(key, shape=(num_firms, ))
        D = jnp.exp(params.mu + params.sigma * Z)
        n_restock, X, key = update_stock(
            n_restock, X, params, D)
        key = random.fold_in(key, i)

    return jnp.mean(n_restock > 1, axis=0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
key = random.PRNGKey(27)
%time freq = compute_freq(params, key).block_until_ready()
print(f"Frequency of at least two stock outs = {freq}")
```

### Alternative implementation with `lax.fori_loop`

Now let's write a `lax.fori_loop` version that JIT compiles the whole function

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def compute_freq(params, key,
                 x_init=70,
                 sim_length=50,
                 num_firms=1_000_000):

    s, S, mu, sigma = params.s, params.S, params.mu, params.sigma
    # Prepare initial arrays
    X = jnp.full((num_firms, ), x_init)
    Z = random.normal(key, shape=(sim_length, num_firms))
    D = jnp.exp(mu + sigma * Z)

    # Stack the restock counter on top of the inventory
    restock_count = jnp.zeros((num_firms, ))
    Xs = (X, restock_count)

    # Define the function for each update
    def update_cross_section(i, Xs):
        # Separate the inventory and restock counter
        x, restock_count = Xs[0], Xs[1]
        restock_count = jnp.where(x <= s,
                                restock_count + 1,
                                restock_count)
        x = jnp.where(x <= s,
                      jnp.maximum(S - D[i], 0),
                      jnp.maximum(x - D[i], 0))

        Xs = (x, restock_count)
        return Xs

    # Use lax.fori_loop to perform the calculations on all states
    X_final = lax.fori_loop(0, sim_length, update_cross_section, Xs)

    return jnp.mean(X_final[1] > 1)
```

Note the time the routine takes to run, as well as the output

```{code-cell} ipython3
%time freq = compute_freq(params, key).block_until_ready()
%time freq = compute_freq(params, key).block_until_ready()

print(f"Frequency of at least two stock outs = {freq}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
