# Adventures with Autodiff

This lecture gives a brief introduction to automatic differentiation using
Google JAX.

Automatic differentiation is one of the key elements of modern machine learning
and artificial intelligence.

As such it has attracted a great deal of investment and there are several
powerful implementations available.

One of the best of these is the automatic differentiation routines contained
in JAX.

As we will see in later lectures, automatic differentiation can be used not only
for AI but also for many problems faced in mathematical modeling, such as
multi-dimensional nonlinear optimization and root-finding problems.


```{include} _admonition/gpu.md
```

We need the following imports

```{code-cell} ipython3
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

Checking for a GPU:

```{code-cell} ipython3
!nvidia-smi
```

## What is automatic differentiation?

Autodiff is a technique for calculating derivatives on a computer.

### Autodiff is not finite differences

The derivative of $f(x) = \exp(2x)$ is

$$
    f'(x) = 2 \exp(2x)
$$



A computer that doesn't know how to take derivatives might approximate this with the finite difference ratio

$$
    (Df)(x) := \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

where $h$ is a small positive number.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def f(x):
    "Original function."
    return np.exp(2 * x)

def f_prime(x):
    "True derivative."
    return 2 * np.exp(2 * x)

def Df(x, h=0.1):
    "Approximate derivative (finite difference)."
    return (f(x + h) - f(x))/h

x_grid = np.linspace(-2, 1, 200)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x_grid, f_prime(x_grid), label="$f'$")
ax.plot(x_grid, Df(x_grid), label="$Df$")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

This kind of numerical derivative is often inaccurate and unstable.

One reason is that 

$$
    \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \approx \frac{0}{0}
$$

Small numbers in the numerator and denominator causes rounding errors.

The situation is exponentially worse in high dimensions / with higher order derivatives

### Autodiff is not symbolic calculus

+++

Symbolic calculus tries to use rules for differentiation to produce a single
closed-form expression representing a derivative.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from sympy import symbols, diff

m, a, b, x = symbols('m a b x')
f_x = (a*x + b)**m
f_x.diff((x, 6))  # 6-th order derivative
```

Symbolic calculus is not well suited to high performance
computing.

One disadvantage is that symbolic calculus cannot differentiate through control flow.

Also, using symbolic calculus might involve redundant calculations.

For example, consider

$$
    (f g h)'
    = (f' g + g' f) h + (f g) h'
$$

If we evaluate at $x$, then we evalute $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ twice each.

Also, computing $f'(x)$ and $f(x)$ might involve similar terms (e.g., $(f(x) = \exp(2x)' \implies f'(x) = 2f(x)$) but this is not exploited in symbolic algebra.

+++

### Autodiff 

Autodiff produces functions that evaluates derivatives at numerical values
passed in by the calling code, rather than producing a single symbolic
expression representing the entire derivative.

Derivatives are constructed by breaking calculations into component parts via the chain rule.

The chain rule is applied until the point where the terms reduce to primitive functions that the program knows how to differentiate exactly (addition, subtraction, exponentiation, sine and cosine, etc.)

+++

## Some experiments

+++

Let's start with some real-valued functions on $\mathbb R$.

+++

### A differentiable function

+++

Let's test JAX's auto diff with a relatively simple function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def f(x):
    return jnp.sin(x) - 2 * jnp.cos(3 * x) * jnp.exp(- x**2)
```

We use `grad` to compute the gradient of a real-valued function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
f_prime = jax.grad(f)
```

Let's plot the result:

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_grid = jnp.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x_grid, [f(x) for x in x_grid], label="$f$")
ax.plot(x_grid, [f_prime(x) for x in x_grid], label="$f'$")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Absolute value function

+++

What happens if the function is not differentiable?

```{code-cell} ipython3
def f(x):
    return jnp.abs(x)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
f_prime = jax.grad(f)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x_grid, [f(x) for x in x_grid], label="$f$")
ax.plot(x_grid, [f_prime(x) for x in x_grid], label="$f'$")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

At the nondifferentiable point $0$, `jax.grad` returns the right derivative:

```{code-cell} ipython3
f_prime(0.0)
```

### Differentiating through control flow

+++

Let's try differentiating through some loops and conditions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def f(x):
    def f1(x):
        for i in range(2):
            x *= 0.2 * x
        return x
    def f2(x):
        x = sum((x**i + i) for i in range(3))
        return x
    y = f1(x) if x < 0 else f2(x)
    return y
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
f_prime = jax.grad(f)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
x_grid = jnp.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x_grid, [f(x) for x in x_grid], label="$f$")
ax.plot(x_grid, [f_prime(x) for x in x_grid], label="$f'$")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Differentiating through a linear interpolation

+++

We can differentiate through linear interpolation, even though the function is not smooth:

```{code-cell} ipython3
n = 20
xp = jnp.linspace(-5, 5, n)
yp = jnp.cos(2 * xp)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x_grid, jnp.interp(x_grid, xp, yp))
plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
f_prime = jax.grad(jnp.interp)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
f_prime_vec = jax.vmap(f_prime, in_axes=(0, None, None))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x_grid, f_prime_vec(x_grid, xp, yp))
plt.show()
```

## Gradient Descent

+++

Let's try implementing gradient descent.

As a simple application, we'll use gradient descent to solve for the OLS parameter estimates in simple linear regression.

+++

### A function for gradient descent

+++

Here's an implementation of gradient descent.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def grad_descent(f,       # Function to be minimized
                 args,    # Extra arguments to the function
                 x0,      # Initial condition
                 λ=0.1,   # Initial learning rate
                 tol=1e-5, 
                 max_iter=1_000):
    """
    Minimize the function f via gradient descent, starting from guess x0.

    The learning rate is computed according to the Barzilai-Borwein method.
    
    """
    
    f_grad = jax.grad(f)
    x = jnp.array(x0)
    df = f_grad(x, args)
    ϵ = tol + 1
    i = 0
    while ϵ > tol and i < max_iter:
        new_x = x - λ * df
        new_df = f_grad(new_x, args)
        Δx = new_x - x
        Δdf = new_df - df
        λ = jnp.abs(Δx @ Δdf) / (Δdf @ Δdf)
        ϵ = jnp.max(jnp.abs(Δx))
        x, df = new_x, new_df
        i += 1
        
    return x
    
```

### Simulated data

We're going to test our gradient descent function my minimizing a sum of least squares in a regression problem.

Let's generate some simulated data:

```{code-cell} ipython3
n = 100
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(1234)
x = jax.random.uniform(key, (n,))

α, β, σ = 0.5, 1.0, 0.1  # Set the true intercept and slope.
key, subkey = jax.random.split(key)
ϵ = jax.random.normal(subkey, (n,))

y = α * x + β + σ * ϵ
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
```

Let's start by calculating the estimated slope and intercept using closed form solutions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
mx = x.mean()
my = y.mean()
α_hat = jnp.sum((x - mx) * (y - my)) / jnp.sum((x - mx)**2)
β_hat = my - α_hat * mx
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
α_hat, β_hat
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x, y)
ax.plot(x, α_hat * x + β_hat, 'k-')
ax.text(0.1, 1.55, rf'$\hat \alpha = {α_hat:.3}$')
ax.text(0.1, 1.50, rf'$\hat \beta = {β_hat:.3}$')
plt.show()
```

### Minimizing squared loss by gradient descent

+++

Let's see if we can get the same values with our gradient descent function.

First we set up the least squares loss function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def loss(params, data):
    a, b = params
    x, y = data
    return jnp.sum((y - a * x - b)**2)
```

Now we minimize it:

```{code-cell} ipython3
p0 = jnp.zeros(2)  # Initial guess for α, β
data = x, y
α_hat, β_hat = grad_descent(loss, data, p0)
```

Let's plot the results.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x_grid = jnp.linspace(0, 1, 100)
ax.scatter(x, y)
ax.plot(x_grid, α_hat * x_grid + β_hat, 'k-', alpha=0.6)
ax.text(0.1, 1.55, rf'$\hat \alpha = {α_hat:.3}$')
ax.text(0.1, 1.50, rf'$\hat \beta = {β_hat:.3}$')
plt.show()
```

Notice that we get the same estimates as we did from the closed form solutions.

+++

### Adding a squared term

Now let's try fitting a second order polynomial.

Here's our new loss function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def loss(params, data):
    a, b, c = params
    x, y = data
    return jnp.sum((y - a * x**2 - b * x - c)**2)
```

Now we're minimizing in three dimensions.

Let's try it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
p0 = jnp.zeros(3)
α_hat, β_hat, γ_hat = grad_descent(loss, data, p0)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x, y)
ax.plot(x_grid, α_hat * x_grid**2 + β_hat * x_grid + γ_hat, 'k-', alpha=0.6)
ax.text(0.1, 1.55, rf'$\hat \alpha = {α_hat:.3}$')
ax.text(0.1, 1.50, rf'$\hat \beta = {β_hat:.3}$')
plt.show()
```

## Exercises

```{exercise-start}
:label: auto_ex1
```

The function `jnp.polyval` evaluates polynomials.  

For example, if `len(p)` is 3, then `jnp.polyval(p, x)`  returns

$$
    f(p, x) := p_0 x^2 + p_1 x + p_2
$$

Use this function for polynomial regression.

The (empirical) loss becomes

$$
    \ell(p, x, y) 
    = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(p, x_i))^2
$$

Set $k=4$ and set the initial guess of `params` to `jnp.zeros(k)`.

Use gradient descent to find the array `params` that minimizes the loss
function and plot the result (following the examples above).


```{exercise-end}
```

```{solution-start} auto_ex1
:class: dropdown
```

Here's one solution.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def loss(params, data):
    x, y = data
    return jnp.sum((y - jnp.polyval(params, x))**2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
k = 4
p0 = jnp.zeros(k)
p_hat = grad_descent(loss, data, p0)
print('Estimated parameter vector:')
print(p_hat)
print('\n\n')

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x, y)
ax.plot(x_grid, jnp.polyval(p_hat, x_grid), 'k-', alpha=0.6)
plt.show()
```


```{solution-end}
```
