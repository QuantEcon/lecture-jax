# Bianchi Overborrowing Model

```{include} _admonition/gpu.md
```

This lecture provides a JAX implementation of "Overborrowing and Systemic Externalities" {cite:p}`Bianchi2011` by [Javier Bianchi](http://www.javierbianchi.com/).

In addition to what’s in Anaconda, this lecture will need the following libraries:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-output]

!pip install quantecon
```

We use the following imports.


```{code-cell} ipython3
import time
import jax
import numba
import jax.numpy as jnp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import quantecon as qe
import scipy as sp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import namedtuple
```

## Markov dynamics

Before studying Bianchi (2011), we develop some functions for working with the bivariate VAR process

$$
   \ln y' = A \ln y + u'   
$$

where 

* prime indicates next period value
* $y = (y_t, y_n) = $ output of (tradables, nontradables)
* $u' \sim N(0, \Omega)$ and $\Omega$ is positive definite
* the log function is applied pointwise

We use the following estimated values, reported on p. 12 of [Yamada (2023)](https://jxiv.jst.go.jp/index.php/jxiv/preprint/view/514).

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = [[0.2425,   0.3297],
     [-0.1984,  0.7576]]

Ω = [[0.0052, 0.002],
     [0.002,  0.0059]]

A, Ω = np.array(A), np.array(Ω)
```

We'll store the data in $\Omega$ using its square root:

```{code-cell} ipython3
C = sp.linalg.sqrtm(Ω)
```

### Simulating the VAR

+++

Here's code for generating the original VAR process, which can be used for
testing.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@numba.jit
def generate_var_process(A=A, C=C, ts_length=1_000_000):
    """
    Generate the original VAR process.

    """
    y_series = np.empty((ts_length, 2))
    y_series[0, :] = np.zeros(2)
    for t in range(ts_length-1):
        y_series[t+1, :] = A @ y_series[t, :] + C @ np.random.randn(2)
    y_t_series = np.exp(y_series[:, 0])
    y_n_series = np.exp(y_series[:, 1])
    return y_t_series, y_n_series
```

### Discretizing the VAR

+++

Here's a function to convert the VAR process to a Markov chain evolving on a
rectilinear grid of points in $\mathbb R^2$.

The function returns arrays `y_t`, `y_n` and `Q`

* `Q[i, j, i', j']` is the probability of moving from `(y_t[i], y_n[j])` to `(y_t[i'], y_n[j'])`.

Under the hood, this function uses the QuantEcon function `discrete_var`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def discretize_income_var(A=A, C=C, n=4, seed=1234):
    """
    Discretize the VAR model, returning

        y_t, an n-grid of y_t values
        y_n, an n-grid of y_n values
        Q, a Markov operator

    The format is that Q is n x n x n x n, with

        Q[i, j, i', j'] = one step transition prob from 
        (y_t[i], y_n[j]) to (y_t[i'], y_n[j'])

    """ 
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    mc = qe.markov.discrete_var(A, C, (n, n),
                                sim_length=1_000_000,
                                std_devs=np.sqrt(3),
                                random_state=rng)
    y, Q = np.exp(mc.state_values), mc.P
    # The array y is currently an array listing all bivariate state pairs
    # (y_t, y_n), so that y[i] is the i-th such pair, while Q[l, m] 
    # is the probability of transitioning from state l to state m in one step. 
    # We switch the representation to the one described in the docstring.
    y_t = [y[n*i, 0] for i in range(n)]  
    y_n = y[0:4, 1]                      
    Q = np.reshape(Q, (n, n, n, n))
    return y_t, y_n, Q
```

Here's code for sampling from the Markov chain.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def generate_discrete_var(A=A, C=C, n=4, seed=1234, 
                          ts_length=1_000_000,
                          indices=False):
    """
    Generate a time series from the discretized model, returning y_t_series and
    y_n_series.  If `indices=True`, then these series are returned as grid
    indices.
    """
    
    
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    mc = qe.markov.discrete_var(A, C, (n, n),
                                sim_length=1_000_000,
                                std_devs=np.sqrt(3),
                                random_state=rng)
    if indices:
        y_series = mc.simulate_indices(ts_length=ts_length)
        y_t_series, y_n_series = y_series % n, y_series // n
    else:
        y_series = np.exp(mc.simulate(ts_length=ts_length))
        y_t_series, y_n_series = y_series[:, 0], y_series[:, 1]
    return y_t_series, y_n_series
```

### Testing the discretization

+++

Let's check some statistics for both the original and the discretized processes, to see if they match up.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def corr(x, y):
    m_x, m_y = x.mean(), y.mean()
    s_xy = np.sqrt(np.sum((x - m_x)**2) * np.sum((y - m_y)**2))
    return np.sum((x - m_x) * (y - m_y)) / (s_xy)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def print_stats(y_t_series, y_n_series):
    print(f"Std dev of y_t is {y_t_series.std():.3}")
    print(f"Std dev of y_n is {y_n_series.std():.3}")
    print(f"corr(y_t, y_n) is {corr(y_t_series, y_n_series):.3}")
    print(f"auto_corr(y_t) is {corr(y_t_series[:-1], y_t_series[1:]):.3}")
    print(f"auto_corr(y_n) is {corr(y_n_series[:-1], y_n_series[1:]):.3}")
    print("\n")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Statistics for original process.\n")
print_stats(*generate_var_process())
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Statistics for discretized process.\n")
print_stats(*generate_discrete_var())
```

## Description of the model

The Bianchi (2011) model seeks to explain sudden stops in emerging market economies.

A representative household chooses how much to borrow on international markets and how much to consume.

The household is credit constrained, with the constraint depending on both current income and the real exchange rate.

Household "overborrow" (relative to a planner) because they do not internalize the
effect of borrowing on the credit constraint.

This overborrowing leaves them vulnerable to bad income shocks.

In essence, the model works as follows

1. During good times, households borrow more and consume more
2. Increased consumption pushes up the price of nontradables and hence the real exchange rate
3. A rising real exchange rate loosens the credit constraint and encourages more borrowing
4. This leads to excessive borrowing relative to a planner.

This overborrowing leads to vulnerability vis-a-vis bad shocks.

1. When a bad shock hits, borrowing is restricted.
2. Consumption now falls, pushing down the real exchange rate.
3. This fall in the exchange rate further tightens the borrowing constraint, amplifying the shock

+++

### Decentralized equilibrium

The model contains a representative household that seeks to maximize
an expected sum of discounted utility with 

$$ u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}
\quad \text{where} \quad
c = (\omega c_t^{-\eta} + (1-\omega) c_n^{-\eta})^{-1/\eta}
$$

Here $c_t$ (resp., $c_n$) is consumption of tradables (resp., nontradables).

+++

The household maximizes subject to the budget constraint

$$
    b' + c_t + p_n c_n = b (1+r) + y_t + p_n y_n
$$

where

* $b$ is bond holdings (positive values denote assets!)
* primes denote next period values
* the interest rate $r$ is exogenous
* $p_n$ is the price of nontradables, while the price of tradables is normalized
  to 1
* $y_t$ and $y_n$ are current tradable and nontradable income

The process for $y := (y_t, y_n)$ is first-order Markov.

+++

The household also faces the credit constraint

$$
    b' \geq - \kappa (y_t + p_n y_n)
$$

Market clearing implies

$$
    c_n = y_n
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    c_t = y_t + (1+r)b - b'
$$

The household takes the aggregate timepath for bonds as given by 

$$B' = H(B, y)$$

and solves

$$
    v(b, B, y)
    = \max_{c, b'} 
    \left\{
        u(c) + \beta \, \mathbb{E}_y \, v(b', B', y')
    \right\}
$$

subject to the budget and credit constraints.

+++

Let the solution to the dynamic program be the policy $b' = h(b, B, y) = $ savings decision in state $(b, B, y)$.

A **decentralized equilibrium** is a map $H$ such that  

$$
    h(B, B, y) = H(B, y)
    \quad \text{for all } B, y
$$

+++

### Notation

Let

$$
        w(c_t, y_n) = \frac{c^{1 - σ}}{1 - σ}
        \quad \text{where} \quad
        c = [ω c_t^{- η} + (1 - ω) y_n^{- η}]^{-1/η}
$$

Using the market clearing conditions, we can write the
household problem as

$$
    v(b, B, y)
    = \max_{b'} 
    \left\{
        w((1 + r)  b + y_t - b', y_n) + \beta \, \mathbb{E}_y \, v(b', H(B, y), y')
    \right\}
$$

subject to 

$$
    - κ (p_n y_n + y_t) 
    \leq
    b' \leq (1 + r) b + y_t
$$

where $p_n$ is given by

$$
    p_n = \frac{1 - ω}{ ω}  \left(\frac{C}{y_n} \right)^{η + 1}
    \quad \text{with} \quad
    C := (1 + r) B + y_t - H(B, y)
$$

+++

We will make use of the policy operator that maps $h$ into

$$
    (T_h v)(b, B, y)
    =
    \left\{
        w((1 + r)  b + y_t - h(b, B, y), y_n) + \beta \, \mathbb{E}_y \, v(h(b, B, y), H(B, y), y')
    \right\}
$$

+++

Our algorithm is

1. initialize $v$ and $H$
2. get a greedy policy $h$ given $v$ and $H$
3. update $H$ via $H = \alpha h + (1 - \alpha) H$
4. iterate $m$ times with the policy operator $T_h$ to get $v = T^m_h v$
5. go to step 2

+++

In other words, we use optimistic policy iteration, updating our guess of the aggregate law of motion every time we update the household policy function.

## Overborrowing model in Python / JAX

In what follows

* `y` = `(y_t, y_n)` is the exogenous state process

Individual states and actions are

* `c` = consumption of tradables (`c` rather than `c_t`)
* `b` = household savings (bond holdings)
* `bp` = household savings decision (next period bond holdings)

Aggregate quantities and prices are

* `p` = price of nontradables (`p` rather than `p_n`)
* `B` = aggregate savings (bond holdings)
* `C` = aggregate consumption 
* `H` = current guess of update rule as an array of the form $H(B, y)$

Here's code to create three tuples that store model data relevant for computation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
Model = namedtuple('Model',
    ('σ', 'η', 'β', 'ω', 'κ', 'r', 'b_grid', 'y_t_nodes', 'y_n_nodes', 'Q'))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

        Q[i, j, ip, jp] = one step prob of moving 

            (y_t[i], y_n[j]) -> (y_t[ip], y_n[jp])

    """

    # Pack and return
    return Model(σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q)
```

Default parameter values are from Bianchi.

Notice that $\beta$ is quite small (too small?), so value function iteration will be relatively quick.

+++

Here's flow utility.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def w(model, c, y_n):
    """ 
    Current utility when c_t = c and c_n = y_n.

        a = [ω c^(- η) + (1 - ω) y_n^(- η)]^(-1/η)

    """
    σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q = model
    a = (ω * c**(-η) + (1 - ω) * y_n**(-η))**(-1/η)
    return a**(1 - σ) / (1 - σ)
```

We need code to generate an initial guess of $H$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def generate_initial_H(model, at_constraint=False):
    """
    Compute an initial guess for H. Repeat the indices for b_grid over y_t and
    y_n axes.

    σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q = model
    b_size, y_size = len(b_grid), len(y_t_nodes)
    b_indices = jnp.arange(b_size)
    O = jnp.ones((b_size, y_size, y_size), dtype=int)
    return  O * jnp.reshape(b_indices, (b_size, 1, 1)) 
```

We need to construct the Bellman operator for the household.

Our first function returns the (unmaximized) RHS of the Bellman equation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def BellmanRHS(model, v, H, i_b, i_B, i_y_t, i_y_n, i_bp):
    """

    function of the next period choice bp = b', with index i_bp.  
    """
    # Unpack

    # Evaluate states and actions at indices
    B, Bp, b, bp = b_grid[i_B], b_grid[i_Bp], b_grid[i_b], b_grid[i_bp]
    y_t = y_t_nodes[i_y_t]
    y_n = y_n_nodes[i_y_n]
    # Compute price of nontradables using aggregates
    C = (1 + r) * B + y_t - Bp
    p = ((1 - ω) / ω) * (C / y_n)**(η + 1)
    # Compute household flow utility
    c = (1 + r) * b + y_t - bp
    utility = w(model, c, y_n)
    # Compute expected value Σ_{y'} v(b', B', y') Q(y, y')
    EV = jnp.sum(v[i_bp, i_Bp, :, :] * Q[i_y_t, i_y_n, :, :])
    # Set up constraints 
    credit_constraint_holds = - κ * (p * y_n + y_t) <= bp
    budget_constraint_holds = bp <= (1 + r) * b + y_t
    constraints_hold = jnp.logical_and(credit_constraint_holds, 
                                     budget_constraint_holds)
    # Compute and return
    return jnp.where(constraints_hold, utility + β * EV, -jnp.inf)
```

Let's now vectorize and jit-compile this map.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Vectorize over the control bp and all the current states
BellmanRHS = jax.vmap(BellmanRHS,
    in_axes=(None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 0))

    in_axes=(None, None, None, None, None, None, 0, None))
BellmanRHS = jax.vmap(BellmanRHS, 
    in_axes=(None, None, None, None, None, 0, None, None))
BellmanRHS = jax.vmap(BellmanRHS, 
    in_axes=(None, None, None, None, 0, None, None, None))
BellmanRHS = jax.vmap(BellmanRHS, 
    in_axes=(None, None, None, 0, None, None, None, None))
```

Here's a function that computes a greedy policy (best response to $v$).

Here's the policy operator

    v = jax.lax.fori_loop(0, m, update, v)

```

This is how we update our guess of $H$, using the current policy $b'$
and a damped fixed point iteration scheme.

Now we can write code to compute an equilibrium law of motion $H$.

## Planner problem

Now we switch to the planner problem.

+++

The constrained planner solves

$$
    V(b, B, y)
    = \max_{c, b'} 
    \left\{
        u(c) + \beta \mathbb{E}_y v(b', B', y')
    \right\}
$$

subject to the market clearing conditions and 
the same constraint

$$
     - \kappa (y_t + p_n y_n) \leq b' \leq (1+r) b + y_t
$$

although the price of nontradable is now given by

$$
    p_n = ((1 - ω) / ω) (c_t / y_n)^{η + 1}
    \quad \text{with} \quad
    c_t := (1 + r) b + y_t - b'
$$

We see that the planner internalizes the impact of the savings choice $b'$ on
the price of nontradables and hence the credit constraint.

Our first function returns the (unmaximized) RHS of the Bellman equation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def planner_T_generator(v, model, i_b, i_y_t, i_y_n, i_bp):
    """
    Given current state (b, y_t, y_n) with indices (i_b, i_y_t, i_y_n),

    """
    σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q = model
    y_t = y_t_nodes[i_y_t]
    y_n = y_n_nodes[i_y_n]
    b, bp = b_grid[i_b], b_grid[i_bp]
    # Compute price of nontradables using aggregates
    c = (1 + r) * b + y_t - bp
    p = ((1 - ω) / ω) * (c / y_n)**(η + 1)
    # Compute household flow utility
    utility = w(model, c, y_n)
    # Compute expected value (continuation)
    EV = jnp.sum(v[i_bp, :, :] * Q[i_y_t, i_y_n, :, :])

    return jnp.where(jnp.logical_and(credit_constraint_holds, 
                                     budget_constraint_holds), 
                     utility + β * EV,
                     -jnp.inf)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Vectorize over the control bp and all the current states
planner_T_generator = jax.vmap(planner_T_generator,
        in_axes=(None, None, None, None, None, 0))
planner_T_generator = jax.vmap(planner_T_generator, 
        in_axes=(None, None, None, None, 0, None))
planner_T_generator = jax.vmap(planner_T_generator, 
        in_axes=(None, None, None, 0, None, None))
planner_T_generator = jax.vmap(planner_T_generator, 
        in_axes=(None, None, 0, None, None, None))
```

Now we construct the Bellman operator.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def planner_T(model, v):
    σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q = model
    b_size, y_size = len(b_grid), len(y_t_nodes)
    b_indices, y_indices = jnp.arange(b_size), jnp.arange(y_size)
    # Evaluate RHS of Bellman equation at all states and actions
    val = planner_T_generator(v, model,
                     b_indices, y_indices, y_indices, b_indices)
    # Maximize over bp
    return jnp.max(val, axis=-1)
```

Here's a function that computes a greedy policy (best response to $v$).

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def planner_get_greedy(model, v):
    σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q = model
    b_size, y_size = len(b_grid), len(y_t_nodes)
    b_indices, y_indices = jnp.arange(b_size), jnp.arange(y_size)
    # Evaluate RHS of Bellman equation at all states and actions
    val = planner_T_generator(v, model,
                     b_indices, y_indices, y_indices, b_indices)
    # Maximize over bp
    return jnp.argmax(val, axis=-1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
def vfi(T, v_init, max_iter=10_000, tol=1e-5):
    """
    Use successive approximation to compute the fixed point of T, starting from
    v_init.

    """
    v = v_init

    def cond_fun(state):
        error, i, v = state
        return (error > tol) & (i < max_iter)
    
    def body_fun(state):
        error, i, v = state
        v_new = T(v)
        error = jnp.max(jnp.abs(v_new - v))
        return error, i+1, v_new

    error, i, v_new = jax.lax.while_loop(cond_fun, body_fun,
                                                    (tol+1, 0, v))
    return v_new, i
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
vfi = jax.jit(vfi, static_argnums=(0,))
```

Computing the planner solution is straightforward value function iteration:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def compute_planner_solution(model):
    """
    Compute the constrained planner solution.

    """
    σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q = model
    b_size, y_size = len(b_grid), len(y_t_nodes)
    b_indices = jnp.arange(b_size)
    v_init = jnp.ones((b_size, y_size, y_size))
    _T = lambda v: planner_T(model, v)
    # Compute household response to current guess H
    v, vfi_num_iter = vfi(_T, v_init)
    bp_policy = planner_get_greedy(model, v)
    return v, bp_policy, vfi_num_iter
```

## Numerical solution

Let's now solve the model and compare the decentralized and planner solutions

### Generating solutions

Here we compute the two solutions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
model = create_overborrowing_model()
σ, η, β, ω, κ, r, b_grid, y_t_nodes, y_n_nodes, Q = model
b_size, y_size = len(b_grid), len(y_t_nodes)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Computing decentralized solution.")
in_time = time.time()
H_eq = compute_equilibrium(model)
out_time = time.time()
diff = out_time - in_time
print(f"Computed decentralized equilibrium in {diff} seconds")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("Computing planner's solution.")
in_time = time.time()
planner_v, H_plan, vfi_num_iter = compute_planner_solution(model)
out_time = time.time()
diff = out_time - in_time
print(f"Computed planner's solution in {diff} seconds")
```

### Policy plots

We produce a policy plot that is similar to Figure 1 in Bianchi (2011).

```{code-cell} ipython3
i, j = 1, 3
y_t, y_n = y_t_nodes[i], y_n_nodes[j]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(b_grid, b_grid[H_eq[:, i, j]], label='decentralized equilibrium')
ax.plot(b_grid, b_grid[H_plan[:, i, j]], ls='--', label='social planner')
ax.plot(b_grid, b_grid, color='black', lw=0.5)
ax.set_ylim((-1.0, -0.6))
ax.set_xlim((-1.0, -0.6))
ax.set_xlabel("current bond holdings")
ax.set_ylabel("next period bond holdings")
ax.set_title(f"policy when $y_t = {y_t:.2}$ and $y_n = {y_n:.2}$")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

The match is not exact because we use a different estimate of the Markov
dynamics for income.

Nonetheless, it is qualitatively similar.

## Exercise


```{exercise-start}
:label: overborrow_1
```

Your task is to examine the ergodic distribution of borrowing in the decentralized and
planner equilibria.

We recommend that you use simulation and a kernel density estimate.

Here's a function for generating the borrowing sequence.

We use Numba because we want to compile a long for loop.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@numba.jit
def generate_borrowing_sequence(H, y_t_series, y_n_series):
    """
    Generate the borrowing sequence B' = H(B, y_t, y_n).

    * H is a policy array
    * y_t_series and y_n_series are simulated time paths 

    Both y_t_series and y_n_series are stored as indices rather than values.

    """
    B = np.empty_like(y_t_series)
    B[0] = 0
    for t in range(len(y_t_series)-1):
        B[t+1] = H[B[t], y_t_series[t], y_n_series[t]]
    return B
```

Note that you will have to convert JAX arrays into NumPy arrays if you want to use this function.

From here you will need to 

* generate a time path for income $y = (y_t, y_n)$ using one of the functions provided above.
* use the function `generate_borrowing_sequence` plus `H_eq` and `H_plan` to calculate bond holdings for the planner and the decentralized equilibrium
* produce a kernel density plot for each of these data sets

If you are successful, your plot should look something like Fig 2 of Bianchi (2011) --- although not exactly the same, due to the alternative specification of the Markov process.

To generate a kernel density plot, we recommend that you use `kdeplot` from the package `seaborn`, which is included in Anaconda.


```{exercise-end}
```

```{solution-start} overborrow_1
:class: dropdown
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import seaborn  # For kernel density plots
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sim_length = 100_000
y_t_series, y_n_series = generate_discrete_var(ts_length=sim_length,
                                               indices=True)
```

We convert JAX arrays to NumPy arrays in order to use Numba.

```{code-cell} ipython3
y_t_series, y_n_series, H_eq, H_plan = \
        [np.array(v) for v in (y_t_series, y_n_series, H_eq, H_plan)]
```

Now let's compute borrowing for the decentralized equilibrium and the planner.

```{code-cell} ipython3
B_eq = generate_borrowing_sequence(H_eq, y_t_series, y_n_series)
eq_b_sequence = b_grid[B_eq]
B_plan = generate_borrowing_sequence(H_plan, y_t_series, y_n_series)
plan_b_sequence = b_grid[B_plan]
```

We suppress some annoying warnings produced by the current version of `seaborn`

```{code-cell} ipython3
import warnings
warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)
```

Now let's plot the distributions using a kernel density estimator.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
seaborn.kdeplot(eq_b_sequence, ax=ax, label='decentralized')
seaborn.kdeplot(plan_b_sequence, ax=ax, label='planner')
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlim((-1, -0.5))
ax.set_xlabel("bond holdings")
ax.set_ylabel("probability")
plt.show()
```

This corresponds to Figure 2 in Bianchi.

Again, the match is not exact but it is qualitatively similar.

Asset holding has a longer left hand tail under the decentralized equilibrium,
leaving the economy more vulnerable to bad shocks.
