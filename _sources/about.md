## About

This lecture series introduces quantitative economics using Google JAX.

We assume that readers have covered most of the QuantEcon lecture
series [on Python programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html).  


## Credits

In building this lecture series, we had invaluable assistance from research
assistants at QuantEcon and our QuantEcon colleagues.
